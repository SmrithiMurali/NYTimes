# Getting Started:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

### git clone https://github.com/SmrithiMurali/NYTimes.git

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command will install all the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. 
It's necessary to run this command before starting the application or running tests.
After running `npm install`, you'll have all the necessary packages installed locally in the `node_modules` directory.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm test:coverage`

This command will run the tests and generate code coverage reports in various formats. You can find the coverage reports in the coverage directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

To ensure code quality and maintain consistency in coding style, this project uses ESLint, a popular JavaScript linting tool.
To run ESLint and analyze your JavaScript code, execute the above command:

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
